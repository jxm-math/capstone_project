	{{\large\textbf{\color{dark}Project Overview}}}
	
	\vspace{0.15cm}
	
	This project aims at building a video analysis system for surveillance purposes. It basically finds and indexes the movement events filmed by a fixed camera.\\
	
	Video surveillance has become a major and widely used tool for multiple issues \cite{video_surveillance} and is supported by many companies \cite{video_surveillance_company_1} \cite{video_surveillance_company_2}. But the huge ammount of information which is usually dealt with has led to the need to use Machine Learning techniques to extract patterns, predictions and other refined information. This approach is being implemented \cite{ml_company_1} and there is much work for Machine Learning engineers to do in this field. \\
	
	An efficient implementation of Machine Learning techniques to video surveillance would prevent users from dealing with a sequential (and manual) search through the (perhaps many hours long) video source, which is rather inefficient, boring and error prone, thus providing a major tool for a wide range of purposes.

	%In this section, look to provide a high-level overview of the project in layman?s terms. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\\
	
	%Has an overview of the project been provided, such as the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data?\\
	%Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?\\
	
	{{\large\textbf{\color{dark}Problem Statement}}}
	
	\vspace{0.15cm}
	
	To apply unsupervised Machine Learning clustering algorithms to detect and quantify the movement events filmed by a fixed camera. The algorithms are to be applied to a tridimensional binary array obtained from the original video after some careful video-preprocessing (see below). Further refinements may also be tackled, such as finding time-parametric curves accurately fitting each movement event. \\
	
	%In this section, you will want to clearly define the problem that you are trying to solve, including the strategy (outline of tasks) you will use to achieve the desired solution. You should also thoroughly discuss what the intended solution will be for this problem. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\\
	
	%Is the problem statement clearly defined? Will the reader understand what you are expecting to solve?
	%Have you thoroughly discussed how you will attempt to solve the problem?\\
	%Is an anticipated solution clearly defined? Will the reader understand what results you are looking for?\\
	
	{{\large\textbf{\color{dark}Metrics}}}
	
	\vspace{0.15cm}
	
	The direct metric to tune the main parameters of DBScan (\texttt{eps} and \texttt{min\_samples}) will be the Sum of Square Errors according to the expected value of clusters, which is known on beforehand for each of the training videos.\\
	
	Once the algorithm is accurately tuned, the metric(s) used to estimate the quality of our clustering will comprise
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Homogeneity
		\item Completeness
		\item V-measure
		\item Adjusted Rand Index
		\item Adjusted Mutual Information
		\item Silhouette Coefficient
	\end{itemize} 
	
	%In this section, you will need to clearly define the metrics or calculations you will use to measure performance of a model or result in your project. These calculations and metrics should be justified based on the characteristics of the problem and problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\\
	
	%Are the metrics you?ve chosen to measure the performance of your models clearly discussed and defined?\\
	%Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on the problem and solution?\\

	\textcolor{dark}{\rule{\linewidth}{2pt}} \vspace{-0.2cm}
	
	%(approx. 2-4 pages)
	
	{{\large\textbf{\color{dark}Data Exploration}}}
	
	\vspace{0.15cm}
	
	The datasets and inputs for this project will be obtained after some video preprocessing made on sample videos. The selected videos are located in \href{https://github.com/jxm-math/capstone_project/tree/master/data/unprocessed_videos}{capstone\_project/data/unprocessed\_videos} and they have been downloaded from \href{http://www.viratdata.org/}{VIRAT Video Dataset} \cite{virat}. The video preprocessing is carried out using the free packages \href{http://scikit-image.org/}{SciKitImage} and \href{http://www.scikit-video.org/}{SciKitVideo} and has been generously provided by \href{http://wardenautomation.com/}{WardenAutomation}.\\
	
	The video preprocessing takes as input a \texttt{.avi} $\texttt{M}\times \texttt{N}$ pixels video and a \texttt{.png} $\texttt{M}\times \texttt{N}$ pixels picture (\textit{background}). For each frame in the video, the frame and the background are compared pixel-wise, and the difference is recorded in a $\texttt{M}\times \texttt{N}$ binary array, where $1$ denotes difference (above some threshold) and $0$ denotes no difference.
	
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=1]{cpj_1.pdf}
	\end{center}
	
	If the video has $\texttt{T}$ frames, then the video preprocessing gives as output a $\texttt{M}\times \texttt{N}\times \texttt{T}$ binary array, which is supposed to capture the movement in our scene and that will be the primary input for the project. These arrays are saved not as arrays as such but as \texttt{.avi} files, and are located in \href{https://github.com/jxm-math/capstone_project/tree/master/data/processed_videos}{capstone\_project/data/processed\_videos}.\\
	
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{cpj_2.pdf}
	\end{center}
	
	The total ammount of data in this latter folder sums up to 10 videos (and a exploratory \texttt{video1.avi}) whose duration ranges between half and three minutes. This should be enough to tune our algorithm (see below) for the purposes of similar (fixed-camera) videos.

	%In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data.

	{{\large\textbf{\color{dark}Algorithms and Techniques}}}
	
	\vspace{0.15cm}
	
	We propose the use of \href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#dbscan}{DBSCAN clustering algorithm}, which is implemented in \href{http://scikit-learn.org/}{SciKitLearn}. This clustering algorithm is well-suited for our generic clusters, which are uneven in size and non-convex.\\
	
	DBSCAN clustering algorithm (\textit{Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise}) takes primarily two parameters
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{min\_samples}, integer
		\item \texttt{eps}, float
	\end{itemize}
	
	and classifies the points in a metric space into three groups
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Core points}: points whose \texttt{eps}-neighbourhood contains at least \texttt{min\_samples} points
		\item \textbf{Reachable points}: points that are not core points themselves, but that cointain some core point in their \texttt{eps}-neighbourhood
		\item \textbf{Outliers or noise}: points that are not core points nor reachable points
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=1.2]{dbscan_illustration.pdf}
	\end{center}
	
	Each group of mutually \texttt{eps}-path-connected core points with the associated reachable points forms a cluster. The way in which the algorithm is implemented may lead to some indeterminisms, such as reachable points reached from two different clusters, but the number of clusters and their intrinsic shape are well-determined.\\
	
	This algorithm has some major advantages that make it well-suited for our clustering problem:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The number of expected clusters is not to be specified. This is crucial, since our goal is to determine the number of clusters / movement-events
		\item The clusters may be of any shape
		\item The algorithm deals well with noise (our arrays, generated from video processing, always have noise)
	\end{itemize}

	\vspace{0.15cm}
	
	The first step in the data preprocessing has been generously provided by \href{http://wardenautomation.com/}{WardenAutomation}. It consists in the extraction of \textit{movement masks}, with the method described above, processing the videos in \href{https://github.com/jxm-math/capstone_project/tree/master/data/unprocessed_videos}{unprocessed\_videos} into those of \href{https://github.com/jxm-math/capstone_project/tree/master/data/processed_videos}{processed\_videos}.\\
	
	The second step in the data preprocessing is carried out by the \texttt{Jupyter} notebook \href{https://github.com/jxm-math/capstone_project/blob/master/data_extractor.ipynb}{data\_extractor.ipynb}. For each frame in the movement masks, it applies
	
	\begin{enumerate}[a)]
		\item Several \texttt{dilation} and \texttt{erosion} processes
		\item Extraction of one color layer
		\item Dimensionality reduction (\texttt{rescale})
	\end{enumerate}
	
	and finally stores the coordinates of the movement points in \texttt{NumPy} arrays in the folder \href{https://github.com/jxm-math/capstone_project/tree/master/data/numpy_arrays}{numpy\_arrays}.\\
	
	%In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\\

	%Based on the Data Exploration section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?\\

	db = DBSCAN(eps=3, min_samples=20).fit(data)
	labels = db.labels_
	
	# Number of clusters in labels, ignoring noise if present.

	print('Estimated number of clusters: %d' % n_clusters_)
	\end{verbatim}

	where \texttt{data} is the arrays of points to be clustered.\\
	
	%In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\\
	
	%Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?\\
	%Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?\\
	%Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?\\
	
	{{\large\textbf{\color{dark}Refinement}}}
	
	\vspace{0.15cm}
	
	The notebook \href{https://github.com/jxm-math/capstone_project/blob/master/parameter_tuning.ipynb}{parameter\_tuning.ipynb} deals with the identification of the optimal parameters \texttt{eps} and \texttt{min\_samples} inside the \texttt{DBScan} algorithm. For each of the exploratory pairs
	
	\begin{quote}
		\begin{verbatim}
		eps in [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]
		min_samples in [40,80,120,160,200,240,280,320,360,400,
		    440,480,520,560,600,640,680,720,760,800]
		\end{verbatim}
	\end{quote}
	
	a \texttt{DBScan} method has been applied to the training data and a Sum of Square Errors (when comparing the output with the expected output registered by direct observation of the original videos) has been stored. The pair in which the best local minimal has been achieved is \texttt{eps = 3 , min\_samples = 120}, and this values have been used for the final implementation.\\
	
	%In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation.
